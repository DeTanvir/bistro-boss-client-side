## Bistro Boss RESTAURANT
***
I have made this react project for a specific purpose. It is a toy showing site for an the company "Toy Heaven". Of course, it's dynamic. A visitor can:
* See the the latest collection of toy specially toy cars from diversed manufacturers
* After seeing the toys, one can see the the details of that toy
* A user can see the ratings of the toys
* After seeing details of a toy, he can also see the collection of what other users like
* Visitors also add any toy as a seller 
* It is responsive, so he can use and see updates from mobile

## The Server
* The site receives data from a live server using MongoDB Database
* The server generates all the data dynamically to the site
